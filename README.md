📊 M5 Store Sales — A Structural & Behavioral Exploration of Retail Demand

Retail sales data is inherently sparse, hierarchical, and event-driven.
Understanding it requires going beyond simple visualizations.

In this project, I explored the M5 Store Sales dataset to uncover the structural and behavioral drivers behind retail demand.

🔍 Key Areas of Analysis:

	•	Product hierarchy (category, department, store)
	•	Zero-heavy sales patterns and inactive items
	•	Time-series dynamics (2011–2016)
	•	Impact of SNAP days on purchasing behavior
	•	State-level demand differences (CA, TX, WI)
	•	Event-driven demand spikes (e.g., holiday peaks)

Key Insight

Retail demand is not random noise.
Behind sparse data and sudden spikes, consistent structural and behavioral patterns emerge.

Understanding these patterns is essential before building reliable forecasting models.
